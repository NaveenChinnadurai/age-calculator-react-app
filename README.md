# Day Finder and Age calculator web App

This is my personal practice project build with reactJS for calculating Age and Idnetifing which day.
In this project,the web app takes date,month and year as a inputs fromt the user and do some mathematical operations to predict the day (Sunday,Monday,Tuesday,....Saturday) accordingly.
Also, user get calculate their age by giving their Date of birth as a input.

I am not better in development, if you identify any mistakes or better method way to do something help me to learn it.
