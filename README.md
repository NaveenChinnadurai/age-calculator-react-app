# Day Finder and Age calculator web App

This is my personal practice project build with reactJS for calculating Age and Identifing the day of the week for the date.
In this project,the web app takes date,month and year as a inputs from the user and predict the day (Sunday,Monday,Tuesday,....Saturday) accordingly.
Also, user can calculate their age by feeding their Date of birth as a input.
